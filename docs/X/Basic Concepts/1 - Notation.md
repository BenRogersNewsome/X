# Notation

Like most programming languages, X defines a set of keywords which have special meaning in the language. In X, many of these keywords are common terms in mathematical logic which have corresponding symbols in logic. These symbols are not present on most ordinary keyboards, and so X provides a written version, and a symbolic representation for each of these keywords, which can be used interchangeably.

| Keyword  | Symbolic Representation | Meaning                   | Example                    |
| -------- | :---------------------: | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `in`     |    `(-`, "∈" U+2208      | Set membership            | `let a, b (- S`             |
| `forall` |    `\-/`, "∀" U+2200      | True for all items        | `\-/ a, b (- G`               |
| `therex` |    `-]`, "∃" U+2203      | There exists an item      | `-] 0, 1 (- F`               |
| `assert` |    `\|-`, "⊦" U+22A6    | Assert expression is true | `\|- a + b = b + a`        |

> **Note:**
> It is highly recommended to use the font #insert font# when working with X, which contains ligatures for nicely rendering the various mathematical symbols used in X.
