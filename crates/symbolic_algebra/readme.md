# Algo

## Packages

### Structures

Provides a base of machinery for representing mathematical expressions and equations as binary trees.

### Matching

Contains the core pattern matching algorithm which is used for performing mathematical simplifications and expansions.

### Manipulation

Provides the machinery for performing mathematical operations to expressions, and for recording a series of mathematical steps.

### Simplification

Contrary to the package name, this package contains an algorithm for both mathematical simplification and expansion.

The reason for this naming is that the mathematical expansion algorithm is virtually identical to the simplification algorithm, only in expansion one can usually do with a lower tree depth.

### Inference



### Display
### Equality
